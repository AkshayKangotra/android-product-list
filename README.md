The purpose of this app is to create a list of products with the following characteristics:


**Screen 1**

  *   Contains a list of all the products returned by an API service call.

  *   It supports lazy loading: scrolling to the bottom of the list lazy loads the next page of products and appends it to the list.

  *   When a product is clicked, it sends the user to the second screen.


**Screen 2**


  *   Displays the details of the selected product.

  *   Has a view pager to swipe to the view next/previous items
